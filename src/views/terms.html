      <h2>
        SOFTWARE USAGE TERMS
      </h2>

      <p>
        Platform Availability and Requirements MT Auto Clicker is available
        across multiple platforms to serve diverse user needs. Our desktop
        applications are available for both Windows and Mac operating
        systems, with no specific system requirements beyond standard
        operating system functionality. The Windows version can be obtained
        either through direct download from our website or through the
        Microsoft Store. An internet connection is required for token
        validation and certain features
      </p>
      <h3>
        Software Updates
      </h3>
      <p>
        We maintain a comprehensive update system to ensure optimal
        performance and security. Users who have installed our application
        through the Microsoft Store receive automatic updates. For direct
        download users, we provide notifications through multiple channels
        to ensure you stay informed about new updates. These channels
        include in-app notifications, email newsletters, and website
        announcements. Our updates regularly include performance
        improvements, new features, security patches, and bug fixes to
        enhance your experience
      </p>
      <h3>
        Installation and Access
      </h3>
      <p>
        We've designed our installation process to be as straightforward as
        possible. No registration is required to install the software, and
        there are no regional restrictions on access. While the software is
        free to use with our token system, we also offer a premium
        subscription for enhanced features. The software can be installed on
        multiple devices, allowing flexibility in how you use our services.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Usage Limitations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of our auto-clicking functionality, MT Auto
        Clicker operates as a single instance per device, requiring active
        cursor control. This means multiple instances cannot run
        simultaneously on the same device, as the software needs exclusive
        control over the cursor for accurate operation. We do not implement
        background operations or usage time restrictions beyond our token
        system limitations.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Cross-Platform Functionality
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each platform version of MT Auto Clicker maintains its own preset
        format and settings to ensure optimal performance within its
        specific environment. This means that presets and settings are
        stored independently on each device and platform. While the token
        system synchronizes across desktop and browser platforms, mobile
        applications maintain separate token systems. This platform-specific
        approach ensures the best possible performance and reliability for
        each user's specific needs
      </p>
      <h3>
        Performance Considerations
      </h3>
      <p>
        The performance of MT Auto Clicker may vary based on your system's
        capabilities and current load. The software's effectiveness can be
        influenced by other running applications and overall system
        responsiveness. We recommend monitoring system performance during
        complex automation tasks to ensure optimal results.
      </p>
      <h3>
        User Responsibilities
      </h3>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for maintaining updated versions of the
        software, ensuring proper installation and configuration, and
        managing their local presets and settings. We encourage users to
        follow platform-specific guidelines and report any issues or bugs
        they encounter to help us improve our service.
      </p>
      <h3>
